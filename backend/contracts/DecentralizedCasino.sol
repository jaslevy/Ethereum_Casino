This is a simplified and conceptual version. In a real-world smart contract, you would need to ensure security practices, handle errors more gracefully, and ensure that the random number generation is tamper-proof and fair. Since Ethereum transactions are public, you would need to handle the revelation of the random number in such a way that it cannot be exploited. You might also want to add a function to allow players to withdraw their bets if they change their minds
